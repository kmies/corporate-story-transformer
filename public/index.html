**The Ordinary World:**
Sales teams everywhere faced the same crushing reality - drowning in leads they couldn't properly qualify, watching promising opportunities slip through the cracks like water through their fingers.

**The Call to Adventure:** 
Then everything changed. What if there was a way to not just manage customers, but to truly understand them? To predict their needs before they even knew them themselves?

**The Mentor & Tools:**
Enter our CRM platform - not just software, but a strategic ally armed with:
- AI-powered lead scoring that reads between the lines
- Email campaigns that feel personal, not robotic  
- Analytics that reveal hidden patterns in customer behavior

**The Transformation:**
Companies didn't just see 40% efficiency gains - they witnessed their teams transform from overwhelmed order-takers into strategic relationship architects. Conversion rates soared as authentic connections replaced cold outreach.

**Return with the Elixir:**
Now these heroes return to their markets not just with better tools, but with the confidence that comes from truly understanding their customers' journeys.`;

**The Tension Builds:**
Picture this: It's 11 PM. Your best salesperson is still at their desk, manually sifting through hundreds of leads, trying to figure out which ones are worth pursuing. Meanwhile, your biggest competitor just closed three deals while your team was still organizing spreadsheets.

**The Stakes Rise:**
Every minute of inefficiency isn't just lost time - it's lost revenue, frustrated team members, and customers who feel like just another number in your database. The pressure is mounting. Something has to give.

**The Turning Point:**
But what if I told you there's a way to flip this entire script? Our CRM doesn't just organize your data - it transforms your entire relationship with your customers.

**Resolution & Victory:**
Watch as automated lead scoring identifies your hottest prospects in seconds. See personalized email campaigns that customers actually want to read. Experience the moment when your team realizes they're not just working harder - they're working smarter, converting 40% more leads with half the stress.

The conflict is over. Your team wins. Your customers win. Everyone wins.`;

**Before: The Struggle**
Meet Sarah, a sales manager drowning in chaos. Her team of 12 was talented but scattered - chasing cold leads, sending generic emails, making decisions based on gut feelings rather than data. Monthly targets felt like climbing Mount Everest in flip-flops.

**The Catalyst Moment:**
Everything changed the day Sarah discovered our CRM platform. Not because it promised easy solutions, but because it promised intelligent ones.

**The Evolution:**
Week 1: The system began learning her team's patterns
Week 2: Lead scoring started identifying the prospects that actually mattered  
Week 4: Email campaigns achieved 60% higher open rates
Week 8: Sarah realized she wasn't just managing a team anymore - she was orchestrating a symphony

**The New Reality:**
Six months later, Sarah's team isn't just hitting targets - they're redefining what's possible. 40% efficiency gains translate to real transformation: More time for strategy, deeper customer relationships, and a team that actually looks forward to Monday mornings.

This isn't just about software. It's about the transformation from surviving to thriving.`;
            } else if (selectedFramework === 'dilemma') {
              transformed = `😰 **THE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE**

**The Crushing Dilemma:**
Every sales manager faces this brutal choice: Spend hours manually qualifying leads and risk missing opportunities, or spread your team thin across every prospect and watch conversion rates plummet.

It's a trap with no good options. Choose speed, sacrifice quality. Choose quality, sacrifice speed. Either way, someone loses - your team burns out, customers get ignored, or competitors eat your lunch.

**The Hidden Third Option:**
But what if this wasn't actually a choice at all? What if the entire premise was wrong?

Our CRM platform doesn't make you choose between speed and quality - it obliterates the trade-off entirely. AI-powered lead scoring gives you both instant analysis AND deeper insights than manual review ever could.

**Breaking Free:**
Suddenly, Sarah's impossible choice becomes laughably simple. Her team qualifies leads 10x faster while simultaneously delivering more personalized, targeted outreach. The dilemma that kept her awake at night? It simply doesn't exist anymore.

Some problems can't be solved. They can only be dissolved. This was one of them.`;
